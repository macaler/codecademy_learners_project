# codecademy_learners_project

This is one of a few Codecademy challenge projects that I completed. Codecademy generated some mockup data meant to simulate certain user information, and prompted several analysis questions involving the data. I also thought of a couple of questions of my own that I answered using the provided data.

Since this is mock data of Codecademy's own users, I am assuming it is Codecademy's proprietary data and not including it in this repository. However, I am including my .sql file so that you can see what the prompts were and how I addressed them.

This project was completed using DB Browser for SQLite.
